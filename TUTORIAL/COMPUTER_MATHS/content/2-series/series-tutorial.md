<h4> What sequence and series? </h4>
<p>A "sequence" (called a "progression" in British English) is an ordered list of numbers; the numbers in this ordered list are called the "elements" or the "terms" of the sequence.
</p>
<p>
A "series" is what you get when you add up all the terms of a sequence; the addition, and also the resulting value, are called the "sum" or the "summation". For instance, "1, 2, 3, 4" is a sequence, with terms "1", "2", "3", and "4"; the corresponding series is the sum "1 + 2 + 3 + 4", and the value of the series is 10.</p>
