<p>C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972.</p>

<p>The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Easy to learn </li> 

	<li>Structured language</li>

	<li>It produces efficient programs.</li>

	<li>It can handle low-level activities.</li>

	<li>It can be compiled on a variety of computers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Facts about C</h3>
<ul>
	<li>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</li>

	<li>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around 1970</li>

	<li>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institue (ANSI).</li>

	<li>By 1973 UNIX OS almost totally written in C.</li>

	<li>Today C is the most widely used System Programming Language.</li>

	<li>Most of the state of the art software have been implemented using C</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why to use C ? </h3>

<p>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adoped as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some example application wrighten in C are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Operating Systems</li>
	<li>Language Compilers</li>
	<li>Assemblers</li>
	<li>Text Editors</li>
	<li>Print Spoolers</li>
	<li>Network Drivers</li>
	<li>Modern Programs</li>
	<li>Data Bases</li>
	<li>Language Interpreters</li>
	<li>Utilities</li>
	<li>C Program File</li>
</ul>
<p>
By way of analogy, let's say that you were going to be learning Spanish, Italian, French, or Portuguese. Do you think knowing Latin would be helpful? Just as Latin was the basis of all of those languages, knowing C will enable you to understand and appreciate an entire family of programming languages built upon the traditions of C. Knowledge of C enables freedom.
</p>

<p>All the C programs are writen into text files with extension ".c" for example hello.c. You can use "vi" editor to write your C program into a file.
This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write programming insturctions inside a program file.

<h3>C Compilers</h3>
<p>
When you write any program in C language then to run that program you need to compile that program using a C Compiler which converts your program into a language understandable by a computer. This is called machine language (ie. binary format). So before proceeding, make sure you have C Compiler available at your computer. It comes alongwith all flavors of Unix and Linux.

If you are working over Unix or Linux then you can type gcc -v or cc -v and check the result. You can ask your system administrator or you can take help from anyone to identify an available C Compiler at your computer.

If you don't have C compiler installed at your computer then you can use below given link to download a GNU C Compiler and use it.

<h3>Hello World Program </h3>

    <div id="cHellowWorldEditor" ui-ace ="{useWrapMode: 'true', showGutter : 'true', theme:'monokai', mode: 'c_cpp', previewId:'preview',

	}" style="min-height:150px;border-radius:10px;"><xmp>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello World! \n");
   return 0;
}	
	</xmp></div>
	<button type="button"  class="cws-button border-radius bt-color-3 pull-right runspace" ng-click="compileAndRunCode('cHellowWorldEditor','preview','c_cpp' )">Run</button>
